WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.

You may need to set the following environment variables:

    $ export VAULT_ADDR='https://127.0.0.1:8200'
    $ export VAULT_CACERT='/var/folders/xj/2xc76jys04x0kc9src604g7r0000gq/T/vault-tls1402311831/vault-ca.pem'


The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.

Unseal Key: SLzJrl48eOKGU+/JiCsbI3AlKoL4cVmC290mzJB7t/A=
Root Token: root

Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!
